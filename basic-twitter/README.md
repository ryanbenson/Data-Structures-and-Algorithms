# Basic Twitter
Reference: Issue #144 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

> Design a simplified version of Twitter, where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow others, and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the userâ€™s news feed.

Some useful functions to include would be:

*   getNewsFeed(userid)
*   postTweet(userid, tweet)
*   follow(follower, followee)
*   unfollow(follower, followee)

## Thoughts

Overall was interesting and fun. It was an interesting exercise to work with the relationships of data, and I feel like if I had a lot of time then I could really extend this.

# Move Zeroes

Reference: Issue #157 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

> Given an array of random integers, move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array

Example:

```console
moveZeros([1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 6]) => [1, 2, 1, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Bonus

Keep this in O(n) time (or better)!

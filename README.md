## Pursuit of Learning
I love learning. I think it's a key part of life to continue to better yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually, in whatever way that means to you.

This is a repo of my coding pursuit to try to expand myself as an engineer. I love [Go](https://golang.org/) as a language, so I'll be trying to do a lot of various exercises to become better at what I do for a living.

## Exercises
I'm getting the exercises from a variety of places, and more:

*   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
*   [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/)
*   [cassidoo newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

## Code
Most of everything will be found in sub directories here. There should be a readme for each directory explaining the problem and any other information.

## Benchmarks
Some exercises may have benchmarks. To run those:

```console
go test ./... -bench .
```

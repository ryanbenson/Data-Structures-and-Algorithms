# Is Golden Ratio

Reference: Issue #242 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/5-time-moves-slowly-but-passes-quickly-alice/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

Given two strings n and m, return true if they are equal when both are entered into text editors. But: a `#` means a backspace character (deleting backwards), and a `%` means a delete character (deleting forwards).

Example:

```console
> equalWithDeletions("a##x", "#a#x")
> true      // both strings become "x"

> equalWithDeletions("fi##f%%%th %%year #time###", "fifth year time")
> false     // the first string becomes "fart"
```

## Thoughts

This was fun! Most of it was simple text processing. The funny bit was how to treat the forward deletes since they needed to be queued to delete future characters.

I did have an idea about possibly evaluating each character at a time that's determined, but given you can backspace and delete, that won't work well because a produced character might be deleted later. So, I realized the best way is to simply understand the final string then compare them.

Overall it runs fast!

BenchmarkComplex-12          	  746710	      1768 ns/op
```

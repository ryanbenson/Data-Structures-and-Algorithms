# Get Number of 1s from Binary of Int
Reference: Issue #147 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

> Given a number n, return the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.

Example:

```console
getBinaryOnesCount(13) => 3
# 13 = 1101
```

## Thoughts

Was an interesting exercise. The standard libs made it easy to convert the number to binary. After that it was pretty simple to do the rest.

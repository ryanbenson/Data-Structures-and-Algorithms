# Add Two Numbers
[Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Example

```console
list1 = 2 -> 4 -> 3
list2 = 5 -> 6 -> 4
addTwoNumbers(list1, list2)
> 7 -> 0 -> 8
```

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

## Thoughts

I had never worked with linked lists before, so it was an interesting exercise. The most simple but only thing that tripped me up was advancing the pointer in the linked list. Once that was done, it was simple math. It was fun and I learned something new!

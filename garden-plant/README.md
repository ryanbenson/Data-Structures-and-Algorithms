**Given an array of 0s and 1s that represent a garden, where 0 is a plot that hasnâ€™t been planted on, and 1 is a plot that has been planted on, return true if n plants can be planted without touching another plant.**

```console
garden = [1,0,0,0,1]

$ canPlant(garden, 1)
$ true // plant at position 2
$ canPlant(garden, 4)
$ false // there are only 3 plots, and two of them can't be planted on
```

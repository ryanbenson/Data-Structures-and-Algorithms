# Is Anagram

Reference: Issue #3 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

> Write a function that takes in two strings and returns true if they are anagrams

Example:

```console
isAnagram("fried", "fired") => true
isAnagram("listen", "silent") => true
isAnagram("bob", "boo") => false
```

## Thoughts

Overall it was pretty simple to determine. Just need to check every letter in each word to ensure every letter matches. A simple, naive, approach is to just sort them both then check them, but that comes at the cost of sorting them, which ends up splitting them into arrays, sorting them, and merging them back. There are more optimized ways of doing this.

# Is Golden Ratio
Reference: Issue #143 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) 🎉 (amazing newsletter by the way)

Given two numbers X and Y, write a function to check that X and Y are in golden ratio.

Two numbers are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. [Check out the formula here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

Example:

```console
isGolenRatio(1, 2)
> false

isGoldenRatio(19.416, 12)
> true

isGoldenRatio(2, 5)
> false

isGoldenRatio(1, 0.618)
> true

isGoldenRatio(61.77, 38.176)
> true
```

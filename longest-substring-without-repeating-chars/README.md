# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
[Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string, find the *length* of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example
*   `Given "abcabcbb", expect 3, as "abc" is the longest string`
*   `Given "bbbbb", expect 1, as "b" is the longest string`
*   `Given "pwwkew", expect 3, as "wke" is the longest string. "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.`

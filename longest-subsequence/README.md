# Longest Subsequence

Reference: Issue #236 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/no-act-of-kindness-no-matter-how-small-is-ever/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

**Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.**

```console
$ longestSubSeq([1, 9, 87, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2, 45])
$ 4 // 1, 3, 4, 2

$ longestSubSeq([36, 41, 56, 35, 91, 33, 34, 92, 43, 37, 42])
$ 5 // 36, 35, 33, 34, 37
```

## Thoughts

TBD

```console
BenchmarkLargestRect-12    	 4547612	       259 ns/op

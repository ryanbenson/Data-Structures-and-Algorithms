# Mean Median Mode
Reference: Issue #134 of cassidoo newsletter

Given a set of numbers, return the mean, median, and mode.

*   Mean = average of all of the numbers
*   Median = the middle number. If there's an even amount of numbers, then it's the average of the two
*   Mode = the number that occurs the most

## Example
*   `Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15, 7]`
*   `Returns: { mean: 8, media: 7, mode: 7 }`

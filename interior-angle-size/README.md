# Interior Angle Size

Reference: Issue #243 of [cassidoo newsletter](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/you-become-what-you-understand-soren-kierkegaard/) ðŸŽ‰ (amazing newsletter by the way)

Given an integer n representing the number of sides of a [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon), return the measure of each interior angle. Bonus points: implement some of the other functions listed in the linked Wikipedia page!

Example:

```console
getInteriorAngle(3)
$ 60 // Each angle in a triangle that is a regular polygon is 60 degrees

getInteriorAngle(8)
$ 135
```
